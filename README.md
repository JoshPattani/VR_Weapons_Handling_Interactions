# VR Interaction Research Project Proposal

## Project Overview

In this project, we are exploring various methods for implementing weapon handling and firing interactions within a VR environment. By developing and testing different interaction styles, we aim to understand how each version influences user experience and usability. Our goal is to simulate the following weapon interactions: drawing a bow and shooting an arrow, drawing and firing a slingshot, throwing a boomerang, and loading and firing a musket. Each interaction will be implemented using multiple techniques to assess their impact on engagement and realism.

## Interaction Variants

We will implement each weapon interaction in the following five distinct ways to gain insights into how each method influences the user experience:

1. **Button Presses**
   - This method will rely on basic button inputs on the VR controller to handle and fire the weapons.
2. **Hand Gestures and Body Movements**

   - Using VR hand tracking and body tracking, users will be able to execute firing actions through specific hand gestures and body postures, mimicking real-life motions.

3. **Direct Object Manipulation**

   - This approach will allow users to interact directly with the weapon models in VR. They will grip, pull, and release parts of the weapon using natural hand interactions to trigger firing actions.

4. **Motion Controller Movements**

   - Leveraging the motion sensors in VR controllers, this method will interpret dynamic controller movements (such as pulling back a bowstring) to handle and fire the weapons.

5. **Combined Input Methods**
   - A hybrid approach that integrates multiple input methods (e.g., motion controller movements with hand gestures) to allow for a more nuanced and possibly more immersive experience.

## Interaction Types and Implementations

1. **Drawing a Bow and Shooting an Arrow**

   - Users will have the experience of pulling back a virtual bowstring and aiming an arrow, with distinct versions implemented using hand gestures, direct manipulation, button inputs, and motion-based inputs.

2. **Using a Slingshot (Handheld and Giant Versions)**

   - We will implement the slingshot in two styles: a traditional handheld version and a large, stationary version. Each will involve varied input methods, like direct manipulation for aiming and button presses to shoot.

3. **Throwing and catching a Boomerang**

   - Users will be able to throw (and subsequently required to catch) a virtual boomerang through motion-based gestures and controller tracking to simulate the real-world action.

4. **Loading and Firing a Musket**
   - This will include simulating loading the musket with ammunition and then firing, using hand gestures, button inputs, and direct manipulation for an immersive experience.
